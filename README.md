## Abstract

FreqFit revolutionizes the landscape of auditory health with its advanced Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) testing application. Designed for precise detection of hearing losses, FreqFit offers a user-friendly interface that combines technological sophistication with accessibility, enabling medical personnel to conduct comprehensive auditory assessments effortlessly. This innovative tool empowers individuals to proactively promotes early detection and intervention for a better quality of life.It facilitates remote testing, making it especially beneficial for healthcare outreach programs in remote areas.

## Problem we are focusing on

FreqFit addresses the critical issue of undetected hearing problems by providing a convenient and cost-effective solution. Hearing impairments, when left undiagnosed, can lead to social isolation, communication challenges, and adverse impacts on mental well-being. The absence of early detection exacerbates these issues. Traditional digital audiometers, which are essential for thorough testing, can be costly and are often unavailable in many locations, particularly in remote areas.

The FreqFit app emerges as a transformative solution, supporting the expensive audiometric equipment by being an alternative. By leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones and utilizing the device as a portable audiometer, FreqFit significantly reduces the cost barriers associated with hearing assessments. This innovation ensures wider accessibility, particularly in regions where the scarcity of proper equipment hinders early detection and intervention. FreqFit not only addresses the challenge of hearing loss but also tackles the barriers to testing, enhancing global accessibility to comprehensive auditory health assessments.
